## Data Formats

W.I Supports four built in data types:
- Genric Xmls (Commonly Supported in game engines)
- Sparrow V1-2 (Default FNF Format)
- Packer (Week 6 TXT Format)
- Json Format (HASH and Array Supported)

[Paths](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/util/Paths.hx) has a easy function to get frames based on a [Data Type](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/data/DataType.hx) value. [getAtlasFromData(key:String, data:DataType, ?library:String)](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/util/Paths.hx#L342).

Also [Character.hx](https://github.com/lunarcleint/Wednesdays-Infidelity/blob/master/source/gameObjects/Character.hx) has a data type paramter that can easily be edited.

****NOTE:****
You have to click reload image for the data type to update
Sometimes it will crash when you do that so you should just add to to the Json

### Scaling Sprite Sheets

Download [Free Texture Packer](http://free-tex-packer.com/) and Install it.

Now you want to export your adobe animate animations as a PNG Sequence, ****make sure your DPI is 72****.

Then put all of it into [Free Texture Packer](http://free-tex-packer.com/) with these settings (you can change these to your liking):

After you've made the sprite sheet look good, export the sprite sheet.
